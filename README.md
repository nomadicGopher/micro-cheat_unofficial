# micro-cheat (unofficial)

A plugin for the [Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) terminal based editor to provide a markdown cheatsheet for the language you're editing.

> [!NOTE]
> This unofficial version was forked from v0.0.5 & contains bug fixes that were left unresolved by the original source for over a year despite PRs being opened. _Primary fix resolves an error that was displaying anytime the Micro editor started (because of an invalid `\` in the Lua source code._

## Usage

Edit a source code file with Micro. Press **cmd-F1** for a cheatsheet of the language to open. Press ctrl-Q to escape back to your source file.

Micro-cheat also provides a command 'cheat' that you can bind to any key or run with ctrl-E.
